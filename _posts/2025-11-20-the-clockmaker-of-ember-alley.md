# **The Clockmaker of Ember Alley**

## Chapter 1: The Broken Hour

In the narrow curve of **Ember Alley**, where lanterns flickered even at noon, lived an old clockmaker named **Theo Marrin**.  
His shop, *Tick & Mend*, was filled with gears, springs, and clocks that never chimed when you expected them to.

One fog-heavy morning, a stranger entered the shop carrying a clock unlike any Theo had seen — a **glass timepiece** with no hands.

> “Can you fix it?” the stranger asked, voice trembling.

Theo examined the smooth face.  
No gears, no openings, no sound. Yet the clock pulsed with a faint, rhythmic glow — *as if it were breathing*.

## Chapter 2: The Time Inside

That night, Theo stayed awake studying the strange object. When the glow brightened, the shop around him froze.  
Dust motes hung in the air like tiny suspended stars.

Theo touched the clock.

Instantly, visions unfolded: bustling streets he’d never walked, people he’d never met, and a great iron tower tearing itself apart in a storm of blue lightning.

When the vision faded, the shop snapped back into motion.

## Chapter 3: What Comes Tomorrow

The next day, the stranger returned.

“It showed you something, didn’t it?” she said.

Theo nodded. “A city collapsing.”

The stranger sighed.  
“That city is *ours*. Or rather — it *will be*, if we do nothing. The clock is a map of tomorrow’s time. And I need your help to fix it… before tomorrow arrives.”

Theo felt the weight of her words settle like dust on his shoulders.  
He picked up his tools.

> “Then let’s mend the future.”

## *End*
